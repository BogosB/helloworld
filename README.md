## LDTS Turma 5 Grupo 04  -  PROJECT HERO

In this project, our goal is to create a text-based RPG game. In the context of this RPG, the player will navigate through a dynamic environment filled with challenges. In this environment, the player will have access to a variety of weapons, each with its own respective stats, which will be used to face different types of enemies. Enemies will have variable stats and strategies depending on their type. Each weapon and monster will have a damage stat, and both the player and monsters will have life stats that can be reduced based on the damage received. Throughout the game, the player must decide on the best strategy to complete the journey, facing monsters and taking care not to deplete their life stat entirely, resulting in a game loss.
In addition to enemies, the player will encounter other challenges such as collecting coins available on the map and navigating around static objects on the path, such as walls and trees. 
The ultimate goal of the game is to progress through the course while enhancing your character, allowing you to eventually confront the final enemy and consequently complete the game.
